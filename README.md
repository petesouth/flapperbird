Started off with a simple sqaure version as a youtube learner.

Then ported it to have actual images for pipes bird.

added animiated floor.

Modified the mechanics how I needed


---------
git clone the app

cd flappingbird

npm install -g expo-cli
npm install --save
npm start


I use Android Studio and run this on the phone emulators once the expo page is up.

This app is run on expo not play store.  but it is native.
