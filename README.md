Used the best of three version tutorials I found.  Created this version
from those projects.

Added images instead of just using squares.  Cleaned up the code a bit.

Should be ready to play


---------
git clone the app

cd flappingbird

npm install -g expo-cli
npm install --save
npm start


I use Android Studio and run this on the phone emulators once the expo page is up.

This app is run on expo not play store.  but it is native.


Once expo is running use the "Run on Android Device"  and it'll push the game to your phone.

You can also isntall the expo-client in app store and use the CRC code to run it on an actual phone with live updates.
